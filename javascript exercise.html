     <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
       JavaScript is a cross-platform,object_oriented
       scripting language.JavaScript is a programming language that adds
       interactivity to your website (for example: games, responses when buttons
       are pressed or data entered in forms, dynamic styling, animation).
       This article helps you get started with this exciting language and gives
       you an idea of what is possible. apps, and much more!</p><p>

       <li><a href=''>Variable Declaration</a>JavaScript variable are containers
          for storing data values- Developers have written a large variety of tools on top
         of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of extra
         functionality with minimum effort. <span>var x</span> <p></p></li>
       <li><a href=''>Operators</a>An operator is a mathematical symbol which produces a result based on two values (or variables). In the following
         table you can see some of the simplest operators, along with some examples to try out in the JavaScript console.<span>
